		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Prologomena is an imaginary restaurant and the brainchild of Aleksandra Skica, a Brooklyn College computer science student who made this project as her first website. </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> She developed a love for cooking when she decided to become a vegetarian as a child and had to prepare many of her own meals. Over the years, her culinary tastes evolved </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> and although she is no longer a vegetarian, her dishes are mainly plant-based and contain only chicken and seafood. The dishes at Prologomena are crafted with attention to </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> ingredients, texture, taste, color, and presentation. Aleksandra takes a holistic look at cooking and regards it as an art and a science. She is a big believer in fats, </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> which she uses liberally in her cooking. Menu highlights include lots of avocado and artisinal cheeses from throughout the world. </p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"> The restaurant's name is inspired by Prologomena to Any Future Metaphysics by Immanuel Kant, a thinker our chef was reading while working on this project. </p>
