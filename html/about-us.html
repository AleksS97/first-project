		<p style="font-size: 20px"> Prologomena is an imaginary restaurant and the brainchild of Aleksandra Skica, a Brooklyn College computer science student who made this project as her first website.
		She developed a love for cooking when she decided to become a vegetarian as a child and had to prepare many of her own meals. Over the years, her culinary tastes evolved 
		and although she is no longer a vegetarian, her dishes are mainly plant-based and contain only chicken and seafood. The dishes at Prologomena are crafted with attention to
		ingredients, texture, taste, color, and presentation. Aleksandra takes a holistic look at cooking and regards it as an art and a science. She is a big believer in fats,
		which she uses liberally in her cooking. Menu highlights include lots of avocado and artisinal cheeses from throughout the world. </p>
		
		<p style="font-size: 20px"> The restaurant's name is inspired by the title of Prologomena to Any Future Metaphysics by Immanuel Kant, a thinker our chef was reading while working on this project and who she she does not enjoy reading. </p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px"> Here is a list of our chef's favorite ingredients: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> Almost anything with truffles </li>
			<li> Avocado </li>
			<li> Goat Cheese </li>
			<li> Ros√© (and yes, it can be a meal component!) </li>
			<li> Salmon </li>		
		</ol>
